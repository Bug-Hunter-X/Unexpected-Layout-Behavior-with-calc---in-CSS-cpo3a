The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly in the following code snippet:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
  height: calc(50% - 5px);
}
```

The issue is that if the parent element does not have a defined width or height, `calc()` will return unexpected results. `calc()` only works if the parent element has a explicitly set width or height.
