# Unexpected Layout Behavior with calc() in CSS

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The `calc()` function is powerful, allowing you to perform calculations directly within your CSS. However, it's crucial to understand its limitations.

## The Problem

The issue arises when `calc()` is used to calculate a width or height relative to a parent element that does not have explicitly defined dimensions (width or height). In such cases, `calc()` might produce unexpected results or fail to work as expected. The parent element needs to have a defined width or height for `calc()` to operate correctly.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the parent element of the element using `calc()` has its dimensions explicitly set using properties like `width` and `height` or other dimension setting techniques like viewport units (vw, vh) or intrinsic sizing.
